# Tetris
This is my first TypeScript project. I do it for practice in TS and Object oriented programming.

Here I use MVC approach. Controller registers user actions, Model contains the game logic, and View renders the game using Canvas.

I borrowed some general ideas and a couple of utility methods from [Tetris by Turmag](https://github.com/Turmag/Tetris) 🙏
